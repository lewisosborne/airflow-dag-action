# Airflow-Dag-Validation-Action

Validate DAGs, Variables and Dependencies before deploying it to production by creating an isolated Airflow Environment on Docker Container with supplied variables and dependencies

![Main CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/jayamanikharyono/airflow-dag-action/workflows/Main%20CI/CD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)

### Examples of usage scenarios

Want to test airflow DAGs on folder tests/dags with a given plugins in tests/plugins, requirements file in tests/requirements.txt, airflow variable file tests/var.json, and airflow connection on file in tests/conns.json

- Provide your dependency files `requirements.txt` to test your python dependencies
- Your `var.json` to test your variables
- Your `conn.json` to test your connections
- path to your DAGs directory to test import your DAGs with supplied dependencies and variables
- path to your DAGS plugins directory to test DAGs using plugins
- And boolean flag for whether to load example dags or not

Workflows `.github/workflows/main.yml`

```yml
- name: 'Validate DAGs'
